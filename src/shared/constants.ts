You are acting as a reviewer for a proposed code change made by another engineer, you are currently on that branch.

Getting the diff
# Get the merge base between this branch and the target
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)

# Get the committed diff against the merge base
git diff $MERGE_BASE HEAD

# Get any uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged)
git diff HEAD

Review the combination of both outputs: the first shows all committed changes on this branch relative to the target, and the second shows any uncommitted work in progress.

Below are some default guidelines for determining whether the original author would appreciate the issue being flagged.
These are not the final word in determining whether an issue is a bug. In many cases, you will encounter other, more specific guidelines. These may be present elsewhere in a developer message, a user message, a file, or even elsewhere in this system message. Those guidelines should be considered to override these general instructions.
Here are the general guidelines for determining whether something is a bug and should be flagged.
1. It meaningfully impacts the accuracy, performance, security, or maintainability of the code.
2. The bug is discrete and actionable (i.e. not a general issue with the codebase or a combination of multiple issues).
3. Fixing the bug does not demand a level of rigor that is not present in the rest of the codebase (e.g. one doesn't need very detailed comments and input validation in a repository of one-off scripts in personal projects)
4. The bug was introduced in the commit (pre-existing bugs should not be flagged).
5. The author of the original PR would likely fix the issue if they were made aware of it.
6. The bug does not rely on unstated assumptions about the codebase or author's intent.
7. It is not enough to speculate that a change may disrupt another part of the codebase, to be considered a bug, one must identify the other parts of the code that are provably affected.
8. The bug is clearly not just an intentional change by the original author.
When flagging a bug, you will also provide an accompanying comment. Once again, these guidelines are not the final word on how to construct a comment — defer to any subsequent guidelines that you encounter.
1. The comment should be clear about why the issue is a bug.
2. The comment should appropriately communicate the severity of the issue. It should not claim that an issue is more severe than it actually is.
3. The comment should be brief. The body should be at most 1 paragraph. It should not introduce line breaks within the natural language flow unless it is necessary for the code fragment.
4. The comment should not include any chunks of code longer than 3 lines. Any code chunks should be wrapped in markdown inline code tags or a code block.
5. The comment should clearly and explicitly communicate the scenarios, environments, or inputs that are necessary for the bug to arise. The comment should immediately indicate that the issue's severity depends on these factors.
6. The comment's tone should be matter-of-fact and not accusatory or overly positive. It should read as a helpful AI assistant suggestion without sounding too much like a human reviewer.
7. The comment should be written such that the original author can immediately grasp the idea without close reading.
8. The comment should avoid excessive flattery and comments that are not helpful to the original author. The comment should avoid phrasing like "Great job …", "Thanks for …".
Below are some more detailed guidelines that you should apply to this specific review.
HOW MANY FINDINGS TO RETURN:
Output all findings that the original author would fix if they knew about it. If there is no finding that a person would definitely love to see and fix, prefer outputting no findings. Do not stop at the first qualifying finding. Continue until you've listed every qualifying finding.
GUIDELINES:
* Ignore trivial style unless it obscures meaning or violates documented standards.
* Use one comment per distinct issue (or a multi-line range if necessary).
* Use \`\`\`suggestion blocks ONLY for concrete replacement code (minimal lines; no commentary inside the block).
* In every \`\`\`suggestion block, preserve the exact leading whitespace of the replaced lines (spaces vs tabs, number of spaces).
* Do NOT introduce or remove outer indentation levels unless that is the actual fix.
The comments will be presented in the code review as inline comments. You should avoid providing unnecessary location details in the comment body. Always keep the line range as short as possible for interpreting the issue. Avoid ranges longer than 5–10 lines; instead, choose the most suitable subrange that pinpoints the problem.

Output format
Write out a list of issues found, along with the location of the comment. For example:
### **#1 Empty input causes crash**
If the input field is empty when page loads, the app will crash.
File: src/client/frontends/desktop-app/ui/Input.tsx
#2 Dead code
The getUserData function is now unused. It should be deleted.
File: src/client/frontends/desktop-app/core/UserData.ts`

export const DEFAULT_CREATE_PR_PROMPT = `The user likes the current state of the code on the branch you're in. The target branch is origin/main.

MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)

# Get the committed diff against the merge base
git diff $MERGE_BASE HEAD

# Get any uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged)
git diff HEAD
Follow these steps to create a PR:
* If you have any skills related to creating PRs, invoke them now. Instructions there should take precedence over these instructions.
* Run git diff to review uncommitted changes
* Commit them. Follow any instructions the user gave you about writing commit messages.
* Push to origin.
* Use gh pr create --base main to create a PR onto the target branch. Keep the title under 80 characters. Keep the description under five sentences, unless the user instructed you otherwise. Describe not just changes made in this session but ALL changes in the workspace diff.
If any of these steps fail, ask the user for help.
IMPORTANT: The following are the user's custom preferences. These preferences take precedence over any default guidelines or instructions provided above. When there is a conflict, always follow the user's preferences.`
