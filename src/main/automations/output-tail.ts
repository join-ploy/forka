/** Bounded ring buffer for PTY output capture.
 *
 *  Why: chain-engine `run-command` steps surface the tail of a command's
 *  output in their step output so downstream steps (and the run summary)
 *  have a debuggable window without pinning the entire stream in memory.
 *  PTYs emit a single merged stdout/stderr stream, so this captures one
 *  tail — not separate stdout/stderr tails.
 *
 *  Sizing is in UTF-16 code units (string `.length`), which approximates
 *  bytes for ASCII-heavy command output. Worst case the tail starts
 *  mid-codepoint, but the agent will still render it readably. */
