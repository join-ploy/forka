/**
 * Group archive entrypoint shared by the GroupCard context menu. Mirrors

 * group-level IPC which fans cleanup out across every member in parallel.
 *
 * No undo affordance in v1: the design doc explicitly defers a "Restore
 * archived group" flow (see docs/plans/2026-05-22-grouped-workspaces-design.md
 * § "Out of scope for v1"). Failure surfaces a destructive toast — the
 * main-process handler has already stamped `archiveCleanupError` on the
 * group so the user can hover the "Cleanup blocked" badge in the visible
 * card to see which member(s) refused.

  // promise toast gives the user immediate feedback that the action is in
  // flight and auto-transitions to success/error on completion.
